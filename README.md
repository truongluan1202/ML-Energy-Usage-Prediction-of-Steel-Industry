## Read ML Project_Regression Problem.ipynb for further analysis

- Engineered an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting energy usage in the steel industry.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, applied clustering techniques, and processed data using scaling and one-hot
encoding. Optimized predictive models with k-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Achieved a low mean squared error of 5.5 using RandomForest, providing actionable insights for energy
management and cost reduction
